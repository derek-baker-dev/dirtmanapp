# This is a Inventory Management and Billing app created using Java and JavaFX created for use in the Dirt Man Business. I was not paid for creating this. This was just a project that I thought would improve efficiency for my father (the owner of the business). It is not a finished project but most of the functionality is there. This app allows one to store items/services with all of their relevant information. Those items can be looked up for reference, the information about them can be manipulated, or they can be put into a bill and that bill is then exported in Microsoft Excel format. Basic styling has also been done with CSS. There is plans to allow changes to a finished bill, but that functionality is not available yet. I plan to continue working on this project and add more features and style eventually.
